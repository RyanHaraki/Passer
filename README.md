# My Personal Project

## Project Proposal
 
The project I'm working on is a **wifi password tracker**. Users can enter the wifi password of different locations.
Possible features include lists of devices associated with specific networks, lists of people who know the specific wifi password, 
as well as password editing and deletion. 

### What will this application do?
The key purpose of this application is to make it easier to remember wifi passwords. Users will be able to save wifi passwords
as well as data associated with the passwords to make it easier for them to remember it. They will be able to 
edit passwords and metadata associated with the password if they ever change, as well as delete them.

### Who will use it?
Anyone who has trouble remembering wifi passwords (like myself) will use this.

### Why is it of interest to me?
I often have trouble remembering the wifi password at my own places, or at friend's homes and
having to ask people for it is a tedious task. I want to have the wifi password wherever I go stored somewhere,
so I'm building this application.

There are a few key indicators that I believe should be associated with a password in order to make them 
easier to track.
- A name to associate the password with
- An address to reference with the password
- The password itself
- A list of devices that are often connected to a specific network
